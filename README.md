# Introduction

This framework allows software engineering managers to have meaningful conversations with their direct reports around the expectations of each position and how to plan for the next level in their career ladder.

Although the framework uses roles and levels that are somewhat standard in the US tech industry, every company is different. Please use the information provided as a baseline and feel free adjust it to your needs.

The framework relies heavily in radar charts to show visually the different perspectives and expectations of a given position:

# Career Ladders

The framework has 4 different ladders:

* [**Developer**](Developer.md): role also known as programmer or software engineer, requires a deep level of technical expertise
* [**Tech Lead**](TechLead.md): role also known as dev lead, is the owner of the system and requires a unique balance between hands-on development, architecture knowledge and production support
* [**Technical Program Manager**](TechnicalProgramManager.md): role responsible for coordinating and driving to completion initiatives that expand multiple teams
* [**Engineering Manager**](EngineeringManager.md): role also known as dev manager, is responsible for the consistent delivery, career growth and level of happiness of the team

| Level | Seniority | [Developer](Developer.md) | [Tech Lead](TechLead.md) | [Technical Program Manager](TechnicalProgramManager.md) | [Engineering Manager](EngineeringManager.md) |

## Tech Lead and Engineering Manager

It is very common for companies to mix the Tech Lead and Engineering Manager roles. Although both roles have some overlap, their focus is different: the Tech Lead is in charge of the *System* while the Engineering Manager is in charge of the *People*.

If the team is small and/or the leader has a lot of experience as Enginneering Manager and Tech Lead, the same person might perform both roles. But as the system and team grow in size and complexity, there might be an opportunity to have different people for each role.

The following is a non-exhaustive list that exemplifies some of the different responsibilities of each role:

| [Tech Lead](TechLead.md) (System) | [Engineering Manager](EngineeringManager.md) (People)|
| :--- | :--- |
| Technical Excellence and Innovation| Career Planning, Promotions and Coaching |
| Architecture and System Integration | Headcount Planning and Hiring |
| Tech Mentoring, Adoption and Alignment | Team Planning and Delivery |
| Technical Spikes and Experiments​ | Objectives, Performance and Feedback |
| Code Reviews and Feedback | One on Ones |
| System Design Presentations​ | Participation in Technical Decisions |
| Technical Capacity Planning​ | Cascading Communications​ |
| Production Issues Escalation​ | Team Building Activities and Culture​ |
| System SLAs, Metrics & Monitoring​ | Team Protection and Happiness​ |
| Platform Direction, Patterns and Practices | Team Productivity and Metrics​ |
| Alignment with other Tech Leads​ | Alignment with other Dev Managers​ |
| Hands-On Coding 50% to 30% of the Time | Hands-On Coding 20% to 0% of the Time |
| System Roadmap (shared)​ | System Roadmap (shared)​ |
| Development Process (shared)​ | Development Process (shared)​ |
| Team Visibility and Recognition (shared) | Team Visibility and Recognition (shared)​ |
| Ability to Act as Engineering Manager when Required | Ability to Act as Tech Lead when Required |

The last point on each role highlights the fact that the lists are not mutually exclussive,  and therefore many of the points from one side are also important on the other side too. An Engineering manager that can't understand the technical challenges that the team is facing won't be successful at the role, the same is true for a Tech Lead that doesn't understand the career paths of the engineers in the team. 

Having said that, although it is important for an Engineering Manager to be able act as a Tech Lead and vice versa, it also critical for them to focus and excel at the right things. Although there is a clear overalp and an opportunity for collaboration, both positions must know well who is responsible for what to avoid conflicts and misunderstandings.

# Axes

The chart shown above has the following 5 axes:
* **Technology**: knowledge of the tech stack and tools
* **System**: level of ownership of the system(s)
* **People**: relationship with the team(s)
* **Process**: level of engagement with the development process
* **Influence**: scope of influence of the position

The **influence** axis can be seen as a *different dimension* since it is orthogonal and applies to all the other axes.

Each axis has 5 different levels of performance. It is important to highlight that every level includes the previous one(s). For example, someone that *evangelizes* technology, *specializes* and *adopts* it as well.

Keep reading to better understand each level.

# FAQs

**What if some of the people don't meet all the points?**

That is very normal, people are usually stronger in some areas and weaker in others. The framework should not be used as a checklist to promote people but instead as guidance to have meaningful career conversations.

**What if my organization's career ladder is different?**

Since the framework is open source, you have the opportunity to adapt it to your organization. Feel free to use the [chart template](charts/template.png) to define your own levels.

**When is a person ready to move to the next level?**

Companies usually expect a person to be performing at the next level *consistently for several months* before formalizing a promotion.

**How do I collect evidence to support the discussion with my direct reports?**

Different teams collect evidence in different ways. A recommended approach is to use a combination of:
* 1:1 conversations
* Feedback from peers and other teams
* Self-evaluation

**Could the framework provide more specific examples of behavior to support each level?**

Specific examples of behavior require knowledge about the way that the team works, the system architecture and its technology stack. It is recommended to allow each team to define their own examples.

**Why does the framework stop at level 7?**

Levels 8 and above vary drastically from company to company. Organizations of different sizes tend to assign a diverse level of scope to positions so high in their structure.

**Do you have any additional resources about the topic?**

[Camille Forunier](https://twitter.com/skamille) does an excellent job at describing the expectations and challenges of many engineering positions in her book: [The Manager's Path](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920056843.do).
